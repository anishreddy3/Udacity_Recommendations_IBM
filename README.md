# Building a Recommendation engine with IBM

This project is a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program built in collaboration with IBM

## Objective

To design and build a recommendation system for the IBM Watson community. It has to recommend the most appropriate set of articles for a given user.

## Features

1. Collaborative Filtering : In this approach we try to cluster similar users and recommends based on the behaviours of similar users.

2. Rank Based Recommendation : In this approach system recommends the most popular articles to the user.

3. Content Based Filtering : In this approach the system recommends articles to the user that are similar in content to the ones they have interacted recently

4. SVD or Singular Value Decomposition : In this approach we utilize Matrix Factorize to predict the ranking of articles
